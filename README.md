# Transfer-Learning-for-Image-Classification-with-PyTorch
This project demonstrates the application of transfer learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images using PyTorch. The dataset is automatically downloaded from IBM's Computer Vision Learning Studio (CV Studio). The project was part of the Coursera course "Computer Vision and Image Processing" by IBM.
