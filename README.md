# Transfer Learning for Image Classification with PyTorch

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of transfer learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images using PyTorch. The dataset is automatically downloaded from IBM's Computer Vision Learning Studio (CV Studio). The project was part of the Coursera course **"Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing" by IBM**.

### Key Features
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraged pre-trained CNN models for efficient image classification.
- **Dataset Integration**: Automated dataset handling using CV Studio.
- **Experimentation**: Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
- **PyTorch Implementation**: End-to-end pipeline built with PyTorch, covering data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### Objectives
- Understand the concept of transfer learning and its application in image classification.
- Experiment with various hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Develop skills in PyTorch for computer vision tasks.

## Results
- The model achieved an accuracy of **80%** on the validation dataset.
- Validation cost at epoch 10: 0.1495.
- Example predictions:
  - Image A: Correctly classified as `stop`
  - Image B: Incorrectly classified as `not stop`
